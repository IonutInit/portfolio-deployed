          Almost a decade ago, I left the linguistics course at the University
          of Manchester to concentrate on Piquaboo, a small family business

          Things went well, and with the magic of the internet we expanded our
          customer base throughout Europe, and our supply network to Germany and
          China

          It was this complexity that drove me to the power and magic of coding.
          What choices do you have when you&apos;re all alone with 100+ column
          csv file?

          In time, I have devised my own bookkeeping and inventory solutions,
          mostly with Excel and VBA.

          Sometimes, things have their own way of working out. Some health

          Now that I am recovered, I finally pursuing programming and web
          development, something I should have done long ago.

          Wish me luck :)
